7. Write a Program to Implement Tower of Hanoi
Description:
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem in artificial intelligence and computer science. It involves three rods and n disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with all the disks stacked on one rod in increasing size from top to bottom.
Goal: Move the entire stack to another rod following these rules:
1.	Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2.	Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3.	No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Code:
# Recursive function to solve Tower of Hanoi problem
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {destination}")
        return

    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination)

    # Move the nth disk from source to destination
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {destination}")

    # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination
    tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source)

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_disks = int(input("Enter the number of disks: "))
    print("Steps to solve the Tower of Hanoi:")
    tower_of_hanoi(num_disks, 'A', 'C', 'B')

OUTPUT:
Enter the number of disks: 3
Steps to solve the Tower of Hanoi:
Move disk 1 from A to C
Move disk 2 from A to B
Move disk 1 from C to B
Move disk 3 from A to C
Move disk 1 from B to A
Move disk 2 from B to C
Move disk 1 from A to C
