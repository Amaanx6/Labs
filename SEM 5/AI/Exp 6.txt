6. Write a Program to Implement Travelling Salesman Problem
Description:
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a famous optimization problem in AI and computer science. The task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.
In this experiment, we implement a solution using:
•	Backtracking
•	Brute Force
•	Or simple heuristics (e.g., Nearest Neighbor)

Code:
from itertools import permutations
# Function to calculate total distance of a tour
def calculate_distance(tour, dist_matrix):
    distance = 0
    for i in range(len(tour) - 1):
        distance += dist_matrix[tour[i]][tour[i + 1]]
    distance += dist_matrix[tour[-1]][tour[0]]  # return to start
    return distance

# Main function to solve TSP
def tsp_brute_force(dist_matrix):
    n = len(dist_matrix)
    cities = list(range(n))
    min_tour = None
    min_distance = float('inf')

    for perm in permutations(cities[1:]):  # fix starting city to 0
        tour = [0] + list(perm)
        current_distance = calculate_distance(tour, dist_matrix)
        if current_distance < min_distance:
            min_distance = current_distance
            min_tour = tour

    return min_tour, min_distance

# Example Distance Matrix (4 cities)
dist_matrix = [
    [0, 10, 15, 20],
    [10, 0, 35, 25],
    [15, 35, 0, 30],
    [20, 25, 30, 0]
]

tour, cost = tsp_brute_force(dist_matrix)
print("Optimal tour:", tour)
print("Minimum cost:", cost)

OUTPUT:
Optimal tour: [0, 1, 3, 2]
Minimum cost: 80
