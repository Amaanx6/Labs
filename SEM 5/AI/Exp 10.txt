10. Write a Program to Implement N-Queens Problem using Python.
Description:
The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in combinatorics and AI involving placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
Rules:
•No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.
Goal:
Find and print at least one valid arrangement of queens on the board for a given N (usually 8 in the classic version).

Code:
# Define the size of the chessboard (8x8 for 8-Queens)
N = 8

# Function to check if placing a queen at (row, col) is safe
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    # Check all previous rows
    for i in range(row):
        # Check if another queen is in the same column
        if board[i] == col:
            return False
        # Check left-to-right diagonal 
        if board[i] - i == col - row:
            return False
        # Check right-to-left diagonal 
        if board[i] + i == col + row:
            return False
    return True  # No conflicts, safe to place queen

# Recursive function to solve the N-Queens problem using backtracking
def solve_n_queens(board, row):
    # Base condition: If all rows are filled, print the solution
    if row == N:
        print_solution(board)
        return True  # Return True to indicate solution found

    # Try placing a queen in each column of the current row
    for col in range(N):
        # Check if it's safe to place a queen
        if is_safe(board, row, col):
            board[row] = col  # Place the queen
            # Recursively try to place queen in the next row
            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1):
                return True  # If successful, stop after first solution
            # Backtrack: undo the queen placement (not required here as overwritten)
    
    return False  # No valid placement found in this row, trigger backtracking

# Function to print the board with queens
def print_solution(board):
    print("One solution to 8-Queens problem:")
    for i in range(N):
        row = ['.'] * N  # Start with empty row
        row[board[i]] = 'Q'  # Place queen at the correct column
        print(' '.join(row))  # Print the row with queen and dots
    print()  # Blank line after the board

# Main driver code
board = [-1] * N  # Initialize board with -1 meaning no queens placed
solve_n_queens(board, 0)  # Start solving from row 0
