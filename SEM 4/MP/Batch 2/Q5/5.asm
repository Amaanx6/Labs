Exp 5: 8 BIT DATA DIVISION 

AIM: 
To divide two 8-bit numbers and store the result in memory. 

ALGORITHM: 
LOGIC: Division is done using the method Repeated subtraction. 
1. Load Divisor and Dividend 
2. Subtract divisor from dividend 
3. Count the number of times of subtraction which equals the quotient 
4. Stop subtraction when the dividend is less than the divisor .The dividend now 
becomes the remainder. Otherwise go to step 2. 
5. stop the program execution. 

RESULT: 
Thus an ALP was written for 8-bit division using repeated subtraction method and 
executed using 8085 p kits
